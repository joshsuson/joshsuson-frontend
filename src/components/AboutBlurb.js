        My name is Josh Suson. I'm a frontend web developer from Concord, North
        Carolina. I believe that the internet and digital products are some of
        the greatest tools mankind has ever invented. Unfortunately, these
        things are being used for the wrong reasons in a lot of people's lives.
        I want to change that. When I decided to become a developer, it wasn't
        just so I could make cool things. It was so I could make cool things
        with a purpose. So I decided to develop on a mission. I want create
        beautiful, simple products that create a positive impact on people's
        lives. If you'd like to know more how I do that or find out some fun
        things about me, please keep reading.
